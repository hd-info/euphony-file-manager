# euphony-file-manager
Web file manager for euphony audio kernel

This web application is a File Manager companion to the **euphony** audio kernel.
It is a fork and much improved version of **node-file-manager** [https://github.com/efeiefei/node-file-manager].

It is not suitable for general use because it is tailored to specific purpose and has several limitations.
